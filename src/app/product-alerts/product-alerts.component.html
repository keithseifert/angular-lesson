<!-- this will display the button if the product provided as input is worth more than 700$. The click
handler uses the EventEmitter we declared in the ts file to emit an event when the button is clicked
See the product list component to see how the event is captured -->
<p *ngIf="product && product.price > 700">
  <button type="button" (click)="notify.emit()">Notify Me</button>
</p>
